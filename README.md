# üóùÔ∏è Design of Algorithms Course Assignments

This repository contains solutions to assignments from the Dsegin of Algorithms course implemented in C++. The assignments are organized into three directories: `CA-03`, `CA-04`, and `CA-05`, each containing four C++ source files (`q1.cpp`, `q2.cpp`, `Q1.cpp`, and another `Q1.cpp`) that solve various algorithmic problems.

## üìå Project Overview

- **CA-03**:
  - `q1.cpp`: Solves a problem involving optimizing food preparation by sorting ingredients and their quantities.
  - `q2.cpp`: Implements a min heap using `std::priority_queue` to process plates with ingredient counts.

- **CA-04**:
  - `Q1.cpp` (Graph): Uses Floyd-Warshall algorithm for shortest paths in a multi-graph with dynamic programming.

- **CA-05**:
  - `Q1.cpp` (Assignment): Implements the Hungarian algorithm to solve the assignment problem for minimizing employee salaries.

## üß∞ Tools Used

- [C++](https://isocpp.org/) for implementation
- Standard Template Library (STL) for data structures like `vector`, `priority_queue`, and algorithms like `sort`
- [GCC/G++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or any C++ compiler for building and running the programs

## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Compile and Run a Specific Program**:
   ```bash
   # Example for CA-03 q1.cpp
   cd CA-03
   g++ q1.cpp -o q1
   ./q1
   ```

4. **Input**:
   - Each program expects input from `stdin`.
   - Example input format for `q2.cpp` in `CA-03`:
     
     ```
     4
     3 1 4 2
     ```

5. **Output**:
   - Programs output results to `stdout`.
